# Decentralized chat system based on ResilientDB
## Project description
### Overview
In today's life, when we try to send a message on most chat software,
the message will first be sent to the central server, 
and then forwarded to the target user by the central server. 
The disadvantage of this is that all data will be captured and stored by the central server, 
which greatly increases the risk of data leakage and leakage of private information. 
Now, we will create a decentralized chat system based on the ResilientDB blockchain. 
This decentralized chat system does not store any personal information, 
and only the sender and recipient can encrypt and decrypt the message during the transmission of the message.

### Key Features
1. **Decentralized Architecture:** Our system avoids the need for a central server. 
All messages are transmitted through ResilientDB blockchain.

2. **Security:** By using the asymmetric encryption algorithm (gpg), 
we can ensure that information cannot be easily cracked during blockchain transmission. 
Only the sender and recipient of the message can use their keys to encrypt and decrypt

3. **Privacy-first Approach:** User data is never stored on any central server. No chat history will be stored.

4. **Open-source:** To ensure utmost transparency and security, our system is fully open-source, allowing community participation and review.
