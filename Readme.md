- User A and B will have their own public key, the key is generated base on their MAC address with PBKDF2 encryption
- When user A want to send a message to B, A will first input user B's public key
- When user A confirm the invitation, system will generate a shared key base on both user A and B's public key
- When user A send a message to B, this message will first be encrypted by ASE and push this transaction onto the chain
- At this time user B will keep reading the blocks and find the corresponding message
- After B found the message, B will decrypt this message with shared key and show the message on screen
- After B successfully get and decrypt the message, B will send an acknowledgement of this message
- If A did not receive the acknowledgement message from B, A will resend the message
