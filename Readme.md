# Decentralized chat system based on ResilientDB
## Project description
### Overview
The Decentralized Chat System is an innovative communication platform designed to offer a secure, 
privacy-centric chat experience without reliance on a centralized server. 
At the core of this system lies the decentralization, offering resistance against single points of failure, 
censorship, and data breaches.

### Key Features
1. **Decentralized Architecture:** Our system avoids the need for a central server. All messages are transmitted on a peer-to-peer basis, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

2. **Security:** Leveraging advanced encryption techniques, we ensure that message content is secured during transmission. Only the recipient of the message can decrypt and read it.

3. **Privacy-first Approach:** User data is never stored on any central server. Chat histories remain only on the devices of the participants.

4. **Censorship-resistant:** Due to its decentralized nature, it's challenging to censor or block this system.

5. **Open-source:** To ensure utmost transparency and security, our system is fully open-source, allowing community participation and review.
